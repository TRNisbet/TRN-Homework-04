TRN 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

The quiz in this repo, functions but not to the parameters set forth in the instructions.  The assignment is past its due date and I am coninuing to make updats to the repo.  The questions cycle and calculate score correctly.  They are stored to local memory, but I do not have them displaying on the High Score page.  The quiz, when finished, does not hide the question and answer buttons.  The repo is done for now, but I hope to come back and fix the remaining shortcomings.  


//The questions are from Geeks for Geeks: JavaScript Quiz sets 1, 2, 3.
